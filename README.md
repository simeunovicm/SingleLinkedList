# SingleLinkedList
This project implements a singly linked list of integer elements. 
The user is prompted to input the desired length and elements of the list, with a predefined maximum length. 
The entered elements are added to the end of the main list. The original list is split into two smaller lists. 
In the split, each odd-indexed element (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) goes into one list, and each even-indexed element 
goes into another list, but in reverse order compared to the input order.

The expected output includes the following:

1. Display of the main list with all elements.
2. Display of the list with odd indexes.
3. Display of the list with even indexes.
